        <p className="aboutusbodytext">My true purpose was far more meaningful.<br></br> 
                I envisioned a platform where exceptional craftsmanship could be recognized in its purest form,<br></br> 
                where each piece could tell its own story without alteration or compromise</p>
                
                <p className="aboutusbodytext">Each item we offer is more than just an accessory; it is a testament to heritage, craftsmanship, and the enduring beauty of fine jewelry.<br></br> 
                My mission was never to create, but to curate—to ensure that these masterpieces find their rightful place in the world, where their brilliance can be appreciated.<br></br>
                That is why XALIA exists. Because true legacy is not accidental—it is intentional. It deserves to be honored, cherished, and passed down with purpose.</p>
